aws-cft-llama-cpp Change Log 

----------------------------------
Dec 16 2024
- updated code to the new cmake build style
- switched to cloning a specific release (b4333)
- updated screenshot showing the new llama.cpp ui 

The rate of (breaking) changes in this repo is very 
high so I switched to cloning a specific release. 

note - I have NOT updated the GPU instance code yet.
The GPU code takes a lot longer to work on because 
the template build time is about an hour
